    <p>
      Born in York, Pennsylvania on the first day of 1955, by the age of eight
      years old, he had begun creating replicas of Old Master paintings, which
      he signed 'Jeffrey Koons' and sold at his father's antique shop. After
      graduating from high school, he enrolled at the Maryland Institute College
      of Art in Baltimore, where he painted neo-surrealist dreamscapes heavily
      inspired by his hero Salvador Dalí.

      Around 1990, Koons lived in New York in a full-service hotel near Wall
      Street. During that time, he did not have a studio.In 1991, he married
      Hungarian-born naturalized-Italian pornography star Cicciolina (Ilona
      Staller) who for five years (1987–92) pursued an alternate career as a
      member of the Italian Parliament. After seeing her picture in two European
      magazines, he had flown to Rome, watched her perform, and gone backstage
      to suggest that they collaborate on what he then thought would be a movie.
      She agreed. A series of strenuous photographic sessions became the basis
      for the "Made in Heaven" paintings and sculptures, in various media. The
      movie never got made, but Koons and Staller fell in love. He courted her
      through an interpreter—she spoke very little English, and Koons, who spoke
      about four words of Italian, kept trying to communicate directly by
      speaking English with an Italian accent. The interpreter had to be let go,
      because she fell in love with Koons. He proposed to Staller in Venice that
      spring, and they were married a year later. While maintaining a home in
      Manhattan, Koons and Staller lived in Munich. In 1992, they had a son,
      Ludwig. The marriage ended soon afterward amid allegations that Koons had
      subjected Staller to physical and emotional abuse.

      began working for Koons' studio in 1995. The couple have six children. The
      family currently lives on several floors of an Upper East Side townhouse.
      In 2009, Koons purchased 11 East 67th Street for US$12 million. In 2010,
      he bought the neighbouring 10,000-square-foot mansion at 13 East 67th
      Street, the longtime home of Barbara Sears Rockefeller, for US$20 million.
      In 2014, he got approval to merge the two buildings into one mega-mansion,
      with a reported renovation cost estimated at US$4.85 million.
